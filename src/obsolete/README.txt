The linux drivers and command line tools are now being maintained in the linux kernel tree.

The versions found here are not being maintained and thus obsolete.

For the most recent versions, please visit:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git;a=tree;f=drivers/staging/usbip

The git tree (git is the version control system used there instead of SVN):
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git

The drivers were already in the kernel tree since version 2.6.28. The userspace tools have been moved on 20110520.
